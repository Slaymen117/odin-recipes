    <p>
        <strong> JAMAICA</strong>  is a simple mixed drink that adds the 
        <br>tropical taste of a pineapple to the popular combination of vodka and cranberry juice.
         <br>It's a variation on the Cape Codder that is delightfully easy to mix up. 
         <br>Also called a Hawaiian sea breeze or Downeaster, the bay breeze is one of those popular cocktails 
         <Br>that all bartenders should know, and every drinker should try.

        This recipe falls into a category of mixed drinks called "duos" and<br>
        "trios," which are uncomplicated tall drinks that combine liquor<br>
    with one or two fruits. They are refreshing, pack a flavorful punch,<br>
    and are among the cheapest mixed drinks you can make at home.<br>
