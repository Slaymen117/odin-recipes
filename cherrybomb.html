    <p>
        <strong>This Cherry Bomb</strong> is a wild cocktail, but before we break down<br>
         the recipe for you, here are some other energy drink cocktail recipes that <br>
         you'll probably enjoy: the Jelly Donut, the Irish Trash Can, the Energy Long <br>
         Island Iced Tea, the Jägerbomb, the Atomic Jägerbomb, and the Absinthe Bull. <br>
         As far as this Cherry Bomb cocktail recipe is concerned, this bad boy mixes up<br>
          cherry vodka, a splash of grenadine, and, of course, some energy drink — i.e. Red Bull.<br>
           It's hard to say where this Cherry Bomb mixed drink was first made or who <br>
           first made it, but we're going to go ahead and guess that it's based on <br>
           the Cherry Bomb firework. It is a bomb shot after all.... If you're looking <Br>
            for other bomb shot cocktail recipes, check out these other Red Bull <Br>
                mixed drink recipes.</p>
